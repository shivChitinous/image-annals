## Scripts to analyze images for an introductory image-analysis course

Scripts were written as assignments for an informal image-analysis course by [Raghuveer Parthasarathy](https://eighteenthelephant.com/about/). 

You can find information on this wonderful course and the assignments [here](https://eighteenthelephant.com/2020/05/05/an-informal-image-analysis-course/).

Note:
`image_analysis.py` contains many functions that were translated from functions written in MATLAB by Raghuveer Parthasarathy.
