## Scripts to analyze images for an introductory image-analysis course

All notebooks were written as assignments for an informal image-analysis course by [Raghuveer Parthasarathy](https://eighteenthelephant.com/about/). 
You can find the assignments and information on this wonderful course [here](https://eighteenthelephant.com/2020/05/05/an-informal-image-analysis-course/).

**Note**:
1. `image_analysis.py` contains many functions that were translated from functions written in MATLAB by Raghuveer Parthasarathy.
2. Images contained in the folders Images and Processed *must not* be used without express permission.
